About

As the first app for publication on Google Play was chosen some flashlight for phone.<br>
Previously,  I read a number of articles on the topic of flashlight app for Android, explored a number of topics on Stackoverflow and watched a number of videos on Youtube.<br>
I was faced with the fact, that in all read/watched sources, I didn't have enough explanations to code. Of course, there were explanations. But these were explanations about writing of application code in general. Or explanations to code block. And it was good, if the block consist of just a few lines of code. But if the block is big - it's worse. I'd like to see from authors more explanations of their code, more detailed comments.<br>
In attach with this, when I was writing my code, I got an idea of write detailed comments to my code and publish it. Maybe, it will be useful for someone, who will face with the same problems as me.<br>
Warn in advance, that this flashlight's code don't pretend on actuality for realities of 2017. I used Camera and Parameters Classes, which are deprecated. AlertDialogs made not as fragments. targetSdkVersion in gradle is 22. App's Activity inheritanced from Activity, not from AppCompatActivity. All of the above is due to the fact, that I wanted min version of Android, with which my app should be compatible, was 2.3.3
